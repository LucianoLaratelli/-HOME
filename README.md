# -HOME
These are the dotfiles for my $HOME.
Inspiration for just having $HOME comes from [@ddevault](https://github.com/ddevault)'s [post on the matter.](https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html)
Many of the things in the (non-emacs) dotfiles come directly from [Mathias' wonderful dotfiles.](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

To clone and install:
```
cd ~
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:LucianoLaratelli/-HOME.git
git fetch
git checkout -f master
bash START.sh
```
